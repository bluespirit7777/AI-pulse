# Architecture

AI Pulse is a **static site** — no backend, no build step for the page itself.
GitHub Actions regenerates a JSON data file on a schedule; GitHub Pages serves
the HTML/CSS/JS. Everything works offline-of-server from plain files.

The page uses a 5-item IA — **Today / Ecosystem / Models / Markets /
Research** — each a `.topsection` toggled by `js/nav.js`. Only ONE top panel
is shown at a time (the others carry `hidden`); within the shown panel, ALL
of its subsections render stacked (Today shows Briefing + Waves + River +
Tide together, Models shows all six, etc.). The `.local-tabs` bar under a
section is therefore a "jump to a section" nav, not a tablist — `js/nav.js`'s
`normalizeLocalNav()` strips the tablist/tabpanel ARIA the HTML still carries
and unhides every tabpanel once at init, and each jump button just scrolls to
its subsection (setting `aria-current` as a light cue). Because only the
active top panel contributes layout, the old deep-link bug — async content
above `#sec-releases` shoving it thousands of pixels down after load — stays
fixed: there's no tall stack of *other sections'* async siblings above any
target. `js/nav.js` maps every legacy hash (`#sec-waves`, `#sec-stocks`, …)
to its `{panel, scroll-target}` in the new IA, so old links keep working. The
section headings use one reusable component (`.section-ribbon` in
`css/app.css`); the top ticker (visible only under Today) pauses on
hover/focus and offers a play/pause control (reduced-motion → manual scroll).

A 6th, visually-distinct topnav item — **Full page** (dashed border, placed
first) — is an explicit opt-in that unhides every panel and every local tab
at once (`activateFullPage()` in `js/nav.js`), for anyone who'd rather scroll
one long page than switch tabs, matching the pre-redesign layout. It hides
the now-redundant local-tab bars and the depth rail (no single "current"
section applies once everything is visible), reuses the exact same DOM/data
as the tabbed views (no duplicate rendering, no duplicate ids), and every
widget inside keeps working normally. `#full` deep-links directly into it;
`goTo()` un-does it automatically when any other nav item is clicked next.
It also re-orders the panels for this view specifically — Ecosystem and
Models lead, per explicit request — via `reorderPanels()`, which physically
moves the existing `.topsection` nodes with `appendChild` (which relocates
rather than clones) instead of re-rendering anything; `goTo()` restores the
original Today-first order when leaving Full Page.

Each of the 3 Frontier Releases cards is a CSS 3D flip container
(`.release-card` → `.release-card-inner` → front/back `.release-card-face`):
the front is the existing release list, unchanged; a "Top videos this week"
button flips to a back face listing that model's `data/youtube-trending.json`
entry. The inactive face is marked `inert` (removed from focus/AT) rather than
just visually hidden, and focus moves with the flip — the same pattern this
codebase's drawers already use. Reduced-motion drops the rotation transition
so the flip is an instant swap, not a spin.

## Files

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `index.html` | Page shell + base styles (design tokens in `:root`). |
| `css/app.css` | Component styles. |
| `js/*.js` | ES modules (no bundler, no framework — served as-is). |
| `data/latest.json` | Current data. The site is fully functional with only this. |
| `data/range.json` | Real per-range stats + daily category history. Optional — absence falls back to "accumulating". |
| `data/stock-network.json` | Ecosystem nodes + 30-day return correlations. Optional — absence keeps the table fallback. |
| `data/entities.json` | Curated ecosystem map config (nodes + relationships). |
| `data/history/events/*.json` | Compact daily event files (60-day retention) feeding range.json. |
| `data/compute-history.json` | Rolling ≤30-day GPU price snapshots (one entry/chip/day), feeding the compute panel's real trend. |
| `scripts/update-data.mjs` | Fetch → categorize → cluster → score → correlate → write. |
| `scripts/lib/signals.mjs` | Pure, tested: clustering, categorization, scoring, verification/impact, topics. |
| `scripts/lib/history.mjs` | Pure, tested: event compaction + real per-range calculations. |
| `scripts/lib/stocks.mjs` | Pure, tested: daily returns, Pearson correlation, relative/dollar volume. |
| `scripts/lib/models.mjs` | Canonical model registry (name/org/version/HN query) — the one source every section reads, so versions can't drift between Ocean Map, Community Pulse, Frontier Releases and the Leaderboard. |
| `scripts/lib/dates.mjs` | Explicit-UTC date formatting (`shortDateUTC`/`dayKeyUTC`) — timezone-stable regardless of the build/browser machine's local clock. |
| `scripts/lib/compute.mjs` | Pure, tested: merges live Vast.ai + RunPod GPU offers into a real price range, filters marketplace placeholder prices, computes a real trend from rolling history. |
| `scripts/lib/text.mjs` | Pure, tested: HTML entity decoding + tag stripping shared by feed parsing and HN comment sanitizing (entities MUST decode before tags strip, or entity-encoded tags survive). |
| `scripts/lib/chart.mjs` | Pure, tested: shapes/rounds the daily OHLC candle series and the price→pixel scaling for the stock drawer's native SVG candlestick chart. |
| `scripts/validate.mjs` | Schema/sanity gate run in CI (latest.json incl. dataHealth + community + range.json + stock-network.json). |
| `test/*.test.mjs` | Unit tests (`node --test`). |
| `.github/workflows/update-data.yml` | Scheduled fetch → validate → test → commit. |

## Design principles

- **No framework.** The page is small and the DOM is regenerated from JSON on
  load; a framework would add weight without buying much.
- **Separation of concerns.** Fetching, scoring, rendering, and styling are
  distinct. Scoring is pure and lives in one file used by both the build and the
  tests.
- **Config-driven.** Ecosystem layers, entities, relationships, categories, and
  statuses are data, not hard-coded markup.
- **Graceful degradation.** Missing history, empty feeds, and failed fetches all
  have defined fallbacks; one failing visualization never blanks the page.
- **Resilience.** Every section renders independently from its slice of the data.

## Local development

```
npm run build      # fetch fresh data → latest.json + range.json + event history
npm run validate   # schema-check latest.json + range.json
npm test           # unit tests (signals + history)
npm run check      # validate + test
npx serve .        # or any static server; open http://localhost:3000
```

See [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md) for the data shape and [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md)
for the scoring.
